            <h1>My story</h1>
            <p>It is interesting that while I looked back on my past academic experiences, I found an obvious split between my past and present.  </p>
            <p>This split, was due to a gap year that I took during covid-19 pandemic. 
            I reflected a lot on the life years before 2020, and tried to rest during that turbulent year not only in my life, but also in human history, because I had found myself exhausted both physically and mentally.
            Although I tried very hard and had achieved a lot during my undergrad years, the fact is, I was also exhausted. My heart was dry and numb.
            That was the time when I started to really ask myself, "Is this the life you want? you want this?" </p>
            <p>And that was the time I felt so insecure and self-doubted. Hence I decided to try another distinct path within my reach, which I had never done before, and hoped that I could get some fresh energy from that. 
            </p>
            <p>The answer to the question : " Is this the life you want?", I still couldn't find nowadays. However, I have learned to listen to my heart, and gained the courage to take a rest if needed. :) </p>
